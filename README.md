#>  [1] "They planned the downfall of economies worldwide with a designer pneumonia. They got the Cartoon News Network and derivatives wrapped around their finger to do their bidding... and now they are appointing themselves as our global Gods. Ha!Lies, lies, lies, lies. Why do we keep falling for these historical power grab schemes? It's not like we can afford to keep learning from the same mistake because technology, surveillance and bio terrorism is advancing exponentially. Eventually it won't matter by how much we outnumber these freaks due to their access to first-hand cutting edge tech.There's a section called: \"Reinventing humanness.\" That should tell you something. It's mind boggling how pathological this reads - stern and full of empty platitudes. I don't think they are very convincing, but all you need to do is say you're a marxist nowadays. \"Neo-liberal\" capitalism didn't fail us. Federal Central banking did. It is the marriage of big gov and big corp and guaranteed banking bailouts that ate away our purchasing power and economy. Very convenient to say that the mess these freaks set up and ran with until it crashed somehow equated to a free market. These old crooks are the same that benefitted from the system they are now erasing. I guess having all the money in the world isn't as great as having all the power with it. What? You think Zuck, Bezos and Gates are cheerleaders of socialism? Maybe for you.It's unfortunate the masses don't believe in small government to be the solution to the problems these beaurocrat crooks create and hide away from. They have effectively scared us away from freedom in the name of safety from the terrorism they continually inflict. Ashamed of my generation for falling for this crap.This is outline of our future, it doesn't matter how much we fight. It's coming. The conspiracists were right all along - it isn't a theory anymore and it has Rothschild written all over it. See, all of the corporations partnered with the WEF are listed on their website. One of them is Gucci, which recently released a 'Build Back Better' propaganda ad with none other than a Rothschild and miss Jane Fonda, who was recently quoted saying: \"COVID is God's gift to the left.\"Even further out of the horses' mouth was miss Lynn Forester de Rothschild letting us know that \"Covid will change capitalism forever.\" Make no mistake, this is the scariest moment of your life-time and you should question whether or not it sounds like a good idea to adopt the solutions imposed by the rulers and destroyers. The Rothschild have funded both sides of historical conflicts for at least hundreds of years. Does it sound similar to the social unrest that has plagued the U.S. and the world? This is a crime against humanity. Our world is ruled by pure evil.As George Carlin put:\"It's one big club. And you AIN'T in it!\""

#>  [2] "Klaus Schwab is a very sick puppy. \"The Great Reset\" the insane idea, has been around since 2016, but they have been trying to find a lever for it all much longer. It was first coined as \"The New World Order\". That didn't catch so well in the masses. Nither did \"The Great Reset\" until Covid, when they ADDED Covid to their book titile, and ADDED covid to The Great Reset. PLEASE don't believe this madman, just because the elietes, like Bill Gates and BONO are buddy buddy with the WEF, doesn't mean that we all want to live in Fascist Slavery, because people, that is what the \"Great Reset\" is. It is the loss, changing completely of humanity. Be scared of this book! Be scared of Klaus Schwab, be scared of the sick plans of WEF. Do not believe these lies. \"The Great Reset\" is a very bad thing and they are forcing upon us under the smokescreen of Covid."

#>  [3] "Having read this book I can honestly say that I think he is confusing Dystopia and Utopia.All he keeps going on about is doing practically everything at home, i.e:Why go shopping when you can shop online and have it delivered to your home.Why go to the theatre, concert or cinema when you can stream all your entertainment at home.Why go to a restaurant when you can order a take away to be delivered to your home.Why go to social gatherings with family and friends when you can all meet up on WhatsApp from the comfort of your home.Why go to a gym when you can use things like Peloton or Wii Fit, yes you guessed it, from the comfort of your home.Why go to a university campus when you can do your course remotely online (yet again from home). How on earth can someone learn medicine or engineering remotely is beyond me to be honest.Some of his claims are just ludicrous. Apparently we are now choosing to shop online more (only because we have been told to stay home and the shops are closed) and choosing to use electronic payments more (again only because we have been forced to). We are more aware of the environment now and are choosing to holiday at home due to fear for our health (nothing to do with the quarantine regulations going abroad and coming back then). But for me the icing on the cake is the statement he made towards the end of the book. If we have a Great Reset incidents like the murder of George Floyd would be totally avoidable. Um, where is he getting that idea from I wonder. Talk about nuts.Basically, what the author really wants is everything online so we can be monitored to the hilt and as many jobs to be done by robots and technology as possible, including the work of doctors and nurses. I wonder if he has shares in any of the Tech Giant companies. This man must be loads of fun to be around. He actually states in the book “Would a Dystopian society really be that bad?” (eyes rolling at this one).The only reason he is getting one star is due to the fact that, having lost my mojo for reading over the last couple of months, I have a renewed spark for my love of books, so some good has come from reading this absolute drivel. If it wasn't for that reason alone and if the facility were available he would have had Zero from me."

#>  [6] "I'm confused.There is no mention of the word 'sex' in this book. No mention of human romantic relationships. 1 mention of 'dating' (in the context of 'our current society is fixated on speed dating' etc). My question here is, how does the pandemic affect this aspect of our lives? I would think the author would have something to say on the subject, since there is an 'AC prognostication' for almost everything else. And I would say that the question of how NEW relationships between humans are likely to be formed, or even possible, in the wake of COVID-19, is possibly the most pertinent and central to our experience as human beings. How to we continue to propagate as a species in a time of social distancing, shuttered cultural meeting places, restaurants that look more like clinics etc? Perhaps (and this is just a theory), we are not supposed to. Perhaps population reduction through attrition is the ultimate goal of the virus (and its proxies). In any case, I find it astounding that the author does not even touch on this subject, but blithely assumes that we will become a better society while staying at home and having all our human contact needs (including the very basic ones??) served virtually. At some point, proximity, stochasticity and intensity of human interaction need to, ahem - 'come together'. In the words of Michael J Fox (aka Marty McFly in Back to the Future \"If there's no music they can't dance, if they can't dance they can't kiss, if they can't kiss they can't fall in love and I'm history\". But the author does not seem to recognise this problem or wish to pay it due attention. Why not?Otherwise I suppose it ticks all the traditional techno-wonky boxes of a utopian grand vision / new world order treatise. Hats off on that front."

#>  [9] "This is a very well (cleverly) written book. And if I was a little less cynical (informed) I might actually think that both authors want 'what's best for us'.But if you think about it : why would 2 economical hotshots (with heaps of money and power) promote a not-for-profit society ? Why would they want a redistribution of wealth, 'so everyone in that new society has the same amount of money' ? I somehow get the feeling that they do not include themselves (1%) when they talk about 'society' ...I found this book very enlightening. It gave me some insight into what the WEF has been dreaming up all these yeaers, and how they plan to go about realizing it.At first, the book made me feel depressed / scared because I realized how powerful these people are and how much they've already accomplished. But after finishing the book, I actually felt elated. It seems to me that many of their assumptions (based on the past) are wrong. I don't think they understand all that well what it means to be 'human'. And that's why I think that in the end, their plans will fail."

#> [10] "Great book summarizing the impact of the pandemic to date and giving high level overviews of where it might take us yet. It presents the hypothesis that Covid-19 has provided catalyst/shock that creates a unique opportunity to begin the 'great reset' needed to enact this positive, sustainable and lasting change. Enlightened leaders and society at large should try and use this opportunity to address the four existential risks that we collectively face: 1) nuclear threats; 2) climate change; 3) the unsustainableuse of essential resources like forests, seafood, topsoil and fresh water; and 4) the consequences of the enormous differences in standards of living between the world’s peoples"

#> [12] "It's an elitist, European university schooled dreamworld of dystopia. Everything is there: - A snobbist view on 'ordinary people' who are racist, nationalist and populist.- 'They' know it better: the economy, how to distribute wealth and resources: for your own good.- A view on the E.U. as it is: an elitist lobbying people hating institute. All this is pimped with quotes from every notable European enlightenment thinker, to make your insane statement more credible. If you're an public servant for an EU-institution, you'll love the book. Everyone else who fears he has to work in enslavement until you drop dead: this is your 1984."

#> [13] "Ok, it isn’t a “conspiracy theory” when they’re openly telling you what they want to do.Nothing new here, all those ideas are stolen from social scientists and transhumanists (without mentioning the sources!!). Klaus Schwab just slightly reshaped their ideas for next discussion at next WEF, by using their slang (\"sustainability\", \"4th technological revolution\", \"goals2030\" etc.) Don't waste your time for this book, just read some reviews (here are some really good ones) to know what's on Their agenda.If you are interested in technological revolutions, I suggest good-old Toffler's The Third Wave or

#> [15] "“COVID-19: The Great Reset” is an exceptional work of incisive analysis and brilliant prognosis of all things related to human life and progress – the right book at the right time. It provides a welcome respite from an avalanche of conflicting news and commentaries, as it deftly separates facts from fiction, with a great sense of balance and equability. With apt references to history, the authors project with realism the possible future scenarios across the entire spectrum of geo-economics, geo-politics, and geo-technology, along with aggravating fault lines and their potential impact on the future of lives and livelihoods.Schwab and Malleret leave no one in doubt that the human race is facing individually and collectively the most challenging times in over one hundred years. The worth of the book lies in their sincere endeavour to build a strong consensus that this indeed “is the time to re-invent the world.” They call for a “re-calibration of social priorities” to draw the contours of what is possible, while explicitly emphasizing the importance of business community to willingly make the transition to stakeholder capitalism.The book makes a compelling case to pursue a “path that will take us to better world: more inclusive, more equitable, and more respectful of Mother Nature,” – but leaving no doubt that this would be possible only if we “summon up the better nature of our angels,” and make the right moral choices. This book is a work of great passion to create a new world, and deserves to be widely read.

#> [17] "More and more people become familiar with terms such as \"build back better\", SDGs, stakeholder capitalism and \"the great reset\". Unfortunately, just a few can understand what it is. The rest prefer the easy way: label it as a \"conspiracy theory\" and move forward (or go back to Netflix if they are currently in lockdown).The Great Reset is REAL and is the mastermind of it is Mr. Klaus Schwab, chairman of the World Economic Forum. \"what's that?\" you might ask, well, for sure you didn't vote for it. Btw, you still vote?The present book is the product of WEF plans to reset humanity in every single aspect.The idea is not new, it has been on the Elite's table since at least 2010 if not since the very inception of WEF in 1971 or since forever.... It's just that it needed a crisis for the agenda to be unfolded for the entire planet.And here's where the covid19 \"pandemic\" appears this year which represents \"a great opportunity\" for a reset. Well, what a surprising coincidence. The Gods are on WEF side this time.So this book tells the story of the future. A future where democracy and capitalism will be replaced by a form of \"green\" totalitarianism, a future in which the individual will be enslaved for \"the greater good\" of society and planet, a future in which we'll be less human and more machines, more tracked, traced, vaccinated, controlled just like a baby or...a cattle. In short, kind of Chinese dystopia.So why 2 stars? because in my opinion, the World needed a reset and I'd say that even the individuals, especially in the Western countries, need a reset even if they don't consciously realize it. Both worldwide economies and our lifestyles need a reset somewhere in the future and I'll be damn, that future is 2020. Not the easy way but the hard way. Humanity is being purified through fire. For Klaus Schwab, we need to burn the past in order to build the future...better.This decision is currently visible everywhere in the world. Some people call it \"covid19\".Why 2 stars still? why not 3 or 4? though I agree with a lot of the things mentioned in the book, I think the approach these technocrats have is profoundly inhumane. The deterministic view they have on the world and the act of \"grabbing the bull by its horns\" always leads to a profound shock and a lot of human misery. They call this \"the end justifies the means\". No humanity appears in this book. In fact, in Klaus' vision, humanity will be reinvented, at the end of social engineering we'll be more machines than humans, we'll fear the others, we'll keep social distancing and aspire for an aseptic world. We'll stay indoors and we'll be \"happy\". The \"virus\" will always be among us because it will justify the profound changes we'll see in the following years.Finally, just a reminder that all these are not fixed, the entire agenda can go to hell completely or we can choose to pick those good things from it. We don't necessarily need to accept to be alienated as humans. We have the choice to remain humans and still act as humans. It's only up to as how much of WEF plans we'll accept? we'll decide to remain humans or we'll prefer to be like cattles? tracked, traced, deprived of all basic human rights, constantly surveilled or we will fight to shape this \"historical moment of time\"? it's only up to us, only to up to as! your shot, humans!"

#> [19] "A Techno-Totalitarian LovestoryI bought this book to gain some knowledge about the mindset of globalists, who are the selfproclaimed \"elite\" of this world, while nobody has ever voted for them to govern our lives. This book is good evidence that these people are living in a bubble, having lost all connection to reality. I will now summarize the main problems I have figured out about the author's perception of reality depicted in this book:1) The free market is responsible for all evil, what we need is stronger governments, preferably such a 'democratic' one as in China. Consequently, the book is full with praise for the Chinese way of life. An assumption which cannot be made by reasonable people who want to live in a free and sustainable world in which the individuum's rights are protected, and not exposed to constant surveillance, which we have in Chinese communism today. Here are some quotes from the book:\"[The situation might provoke changes such as] an augmented search for the common good as a policy objective, the notion of fairness acquiring political potency, radical welfare and taxation measures, [...]\" (p.18)\"the Confucianism prevalent in so many Asian countries places a sense of duty and generational solidarity before individual rights; it also puts high value on measures and rules that benefit the community as a whole.\" (p.88)\"The Covid-19 pandemic has made government important again. Not just powerful again, but also vital again[...]\" (p.89, the author quoting John Micklethwait)\"Acute crises contribute to boosting the power of the state. It's always been the case and there is no reason why it should be different with the Covid-19 pandemic.\" (p.89)\"[...] the role of the state has shrunk considerably. This is a situation that is set to change because it is hard to imagine how an exogenous shock of such magnitute [...]could be addressed with purely market-based solutions.\" (p.91)\"On the dial that measures the continuum between the government and the markets, the needle has decisively moved towards the left.\" (p.92)\"For the first time [...] governments have the upper hand. [...] Rather than simply fixing market failures when they arise, they should, as suggested by the economist Mariana Mazzucato: 'move towards actively shaping and creating markets that deliver sustainable and inclusive growth.' \" (p.92)\"A significant element of new \"bigger\" government is already in place with the vastly increased and quasi-immediate government control of the economy.\" (p.92)\"Looking to the future, governments will most likely [...] decide that it's in the best interest of society to rewrite some of the rules of the game and permanently increase their role.\" (p.93)\"the role of the state will increase and, in doing so, will materially affect the way business is conducted. [...] business executives in all industries and all countries will have to adapt to greater government intervention. [...] Taxation will increase, particularly for the most privileged\" (p.94)\"While in the past the US was always the first to arrive with aid where assistance was needed, this role now belongs to China\" (p. 123)2) The author is also totally in love with the concept of mass surveillance. He writes:\"The containment of the coronavirus pandemic will necessitate a global surveillance network\" (p.33)\"We will see how contact tracing has an unequalled capacity and a quasi.-essential place in the armoury needed to combat Covid-19, while at the same time being positioned to become an enabler of mass surveillance.\" (p.153)\"An important lesson can be learned from the countries that were more effective in dealing with the pandemic (in particular Asian nations): technology in general and digital in particular help. Successful contact tracing proved to be a key component of a successful strategy against Covid-19.\" (p.159)\"Contact tracing and tracking are therefore essential components of our public-health response to Covid-19\" (p.160)\"China, Hong Kong SAR and South Korea implemented coercive and intrusive measures of digital tracing. They took the decision to track individuals without their consent, through their mobile and credit card data, and even employed video surveillance\" (p.160)\"The digital tracing solution most lauded and talked about was the TraceTogether app run by Singapore's Ministry of Health. It seems to offer the \"ideal\" balance between efficiency and privacy concerns[...]\" (p.160)\"No voluntary contact-tracing app will work if people are unwilling to provide their own personal data to the governmental agency that monitors the system\" (p.164)\"[...]the corporate move will be towards greater surveillance; for better or for worse, companies will be watching and sometimes recording what their workforce does.\" (p.165)\"[...] any digital experience that we have can be turned into a \"product\" destined to monitor and anticipate our behaviour.\" (p.166f)\"Then, when the crisis is over, some may realize that their country has suddenly be transformed into a place where they no longer wish to live.\" (p.167)Even after mentioning all the dangers of constant surveillance, the author concludes that \"the genie of tech surveillance will not be put back into the bottle.\" (p.171)He also really thinks that \"Dystopian scenarios are not a fatality.\"(p.171)How we can avoid this dystopia, he does not explain in the book. But that does not seem to be the aim of the book anyway - it is rather a praise of mass surveillance and privacy does not concern the author very much.At the same time the author admits that \"the consequences of Covid-19 in terms of health and mortality will be mild compared to previous pandemics. At the end of June 2020, Covid-19 has killed less than 0,006% of the world population.\" (p.247) And admitting that \"the average age of those dying of Covid-19 is almost 80 years [in Italy]\" (p.221) But that does not change his mind, he still propagates mass surveillance and the necessity of lockdowns.4) While I understand that it is good to also see the advantages to this worldwide disaster, the author is using surprisingly positive language during his analysis of the situation:\"The possibilities for change and the resulting new order are now unlimited and only bound to our imagination\" and \"We should take advantage of this unprecedented opportunity to reimagine our world\" (p.19)Later he even uses phrases like \"not letting the crisis go to waste\" (p.145 or p.142f) and \"making good use of the pandemic\" (p.145). My personal impression is that the author is very happy about the coronavirus and its induced opportunities. He even says that this crisis is \"accelerating progress towards the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals\" (p.248f). He is certainly not concerned much about the whole situation.5) Paradoxical are also the author's statements concerning unemployment, work and poverty. On one page he is praising the new jobs created by the crisis in the digital/online/robotic industry, but on other pages he also sees the danger of millions of people being put out of work. But his book does not sound like a warning, it sounds like an advertisement for the first group of industry which is profitting from the crisis. It sounds like this: \"It is good that the ship is sinking, because we will create some jobs, when the shipwreck has to be lifted out of the water.\"During the whole book the author keeps talking about \"social safety nets\" necessary to prevent uproars and riots, because of all the unemployment, which will be the result of the lockdowns. The idea sounds good, but who is going to pay the safety net when huge amounts of people rely on the state? The powerful state, propagated in this book needs massively high taxes anyway, which is putting even higher pressure on the working population. It does not look realistic to me. The book does not really give different answers to all the massive problems, except for \"the state saving us\". Which I personally find ridiculous, because the state never cares about individuals as we can clearly see in China.6) The underlying message of the book is: We need a global governance to be better prepared for such situations. The virus, the C02 problem, climate change etc. could only be tackled with a global leadership. The idea sounds ridiculous to me - how would a world government have changed the spreading of a virus? By more surveillance and more lockdowns? How would it reduce C02 emission? By forbidding certain industries and putting 80% of the world's population into unemployment? How would this reduce climate change? By more laws and regulations? I think these are all just excuses to install a world leadership and many people can see that by now.7) While writing about how the virus and the lockdown messed up the \"whole world\", he completely forgot to mention countries which did not have a lockdown at all. Many of his thesises can be debunked by simply looking at Sweden. This country has successfully avoided destroying its own economy while having no lockdown, no masks, no social distancing etc. at all. No need for surveillance, technology etc. It is no surprise that the author does not mention this country a single time in the whole book. On page 45 he is talking about two studies that \"modelled what could have happened without lockdown\", instead of simply looking at the real example of Sweden, I guess it did not fit the narrative.8) The author often talks about \"clean energy\" (e.g. p.145) and he is obviously condemning fossile fuels, while wishing for a future full with (electric) sensors and \"remoted devices\", surveillance cameras etc. which all need energy. He nowhere explains where this energy should come from. Solar and wind power are long debunked. They are inefficient and not stable sources of energy. Nuclear and coal most propably are not appreciated by the author either, so what is left? (Maybe the author knows something, we do not know). I also like to remind the fans of electric devices how batteries are made, with huge environmental damage. Here is one more quote about the author's idea of energy supply: \"A group of green activists could demonstrate in front of a coal-fired power plant\" (p.149)9) The author is so entangled in his vision of the future, economics, numbers and science, that he makes a lot of unreasonable assumptions in this book. Especially when it comes to human, social behaviour. Here are some of them, which are particularly entertaining:\"As consumers may prefer automated services to face-to-face interactions [...]\" (p.55)\"changing course will require a shift in the mindset of world leaders to place greater focus and priority on the well-being of all citizens and the planet\" (p.58)\"The idea [of helicopter money] is appealing and realizable\" (p.68)\"[Central bankers] will have to define an upper limit at which inflation becomes disruptive and a real concern.\" (p.69)\"The post-pandemic era will usher in a period of massive wealth redistribution, from the rich to the poor [!!] and from capital to labour.\" (p.78)\"In America as in many other countries, African Americans are poorer, more likely to be unemployed or underemployed and victims of substandard housing and living conditions. As a result they suffer more from pre-existing health conditions like obesity, heart disease or diabetes\" (p.80f) (Obesity, heart disease and diabetes are mostly caused by overeating, bad diets, or unhealthy livestyle and not by social inequality.)\"the three things that matter most to a great majority of us: housing, healthcare and education\" (p.96)How about family, friends, peace or a good job?\"calls for more spending (and therefore higher taxes) will get louder\" (p.99)\"An increasing number of scientists have shown that it is in fact the destruction of biodiversity caused by humans that is the source of new viruses like Covid-19\" (p.138) (of course it has nothing to do with the Wuhan lab...)\"bicycling and walking instead of driving to keep the air of our cities as clean as it was during the lockdowns, vacationing nearer to home[...]could lead to a sustained reduction in carbon emissions.\" (p.142) (I can already imagine the author on a bicycle... Well, I guess it is only the solution for the poor masses which cannot afford a car any longer due to taxes and green unemployment?! It is also ironic that the author mentions somewhere else in the book that most carbon emission comes from the industry and other sources anyway, not from cars or home applications - as long as you do not have a smart house full of sensors, I guess...)\"[Mobile devices] helping us on many different fronts, anticipating our needs, listening to us and locating us, even when not asked to do so...\" (p.152) (Sounds like a great \"help\" to me...)\" [Instead of] driving to a distant family gathering for the weekend\" using \"the WhatsApp family group\" which \"is not as fun but, again, safer, cheaper and greener\" (p.155)\"[Robots] saving nurses as much as three hours' work per day.\" (p.159) (Which leads to more unemployed nurses)\"just as the terrorist attacks of 9/11 triggered greater and permanent security in the name of public safety.\" (p.168) (So that's what it was good for, thanks for letting us know.)\"This won't happen, because it can't happen.\" (p.173) (Author talking about industry leaders which might want to go back to the old way of making business.)\"It is likely that the markets or the consumers, or both, will punish those companies that performed poorly on social issues (p.188) (Good example is the Amazon website on which I also published this review)\"Simple pleasures like smelling a melon or squeezing a fruit will be frowned upon and may even become a thing of the past.\" (p.198) (For the sake of hygiene...)10) The author's ideological understanding of human beings is also very interesting:\"if, as human beings, we do not collaborate to confront our existential challenges, we are doomed. Thus, we have no choice but to summon up the better angels of our nature.\" (p.217) On other occasions the author is talking about man as \"a social animal\" showing a Darwinian mindset, but here it sounds quite religious. A typical contradiction of utopian thought. He further speculates: \"if in the future we abandon the posture of self-interest that pollutes so many of our social interactions, [...]\" (p.224) This has not happened for the last thousands of years and no ideology will change this. I therefore highly question the author's knowledge about the character of human beings and ask him to be more realistic, please.11) Psychological effects of \"The Great Reset\" [.....](Please read the remaining two points on my amazon review, there is a character limit on goodreads, what a pity.

#> [20] "2 Stars. Why? Because there is SOME useful information, based on the fact that after all Schwab is one of the people who are pushing so hard the new agenda, which is hidden behind soft words like \"green\", \"equality\", \"justice\" and so on, but what the reader should know is that the purpose of the reset is not that. In fact the main idea is more surveillance, more dictatorship, of course...just like the authors said justified from the pandemic and the future pandemics that will come. This book shouldn't be read without critical thinking and I would suggest, before reading it...please... inform yourself about who Klaus Schwab really is (I mean... one article in Wikipedia is definitely not enough). If I haven't read it until the end, I would easily put 1 star, but all in all - it is not insanely long book, and it is more like informative literature on what THEY plan to come, not what it \"might\" come as the author states.

#> [22] "The writers connect George Floyd death and BLM riots with COVID 19 to suggest we need a \"great reset\". What is the great reset, you ask? The \"new normal\" AKA dystopian hell will consist of global control with constant serveillance. They applaud the lockdowns for saving lives but overlook any mention of massive increase in suicides. Lockdowns causing starvation due to supply line problems? These are acceptable losses for \"the greater good.\" The writers actually quote Bill Gates and Henry Kissinger (that speaks volumes). They write about \"enlightened leadership\" but list the prince of wales (best friend was Jimy Savile a notorious pedophile) and Andrew Cuomo (sent COVID positive patients to nursing homes and spread COVID to vulnerable elderly killing 20K). Yes, of course, that is \"enlightened leadership.\" Who knew? The writers bizarrely use the 40K ventilators that were projected as being necessary as an example to push glabalism when it was the private sector that filled the demand and crazily enough, most of those weren't even used. I have to quote a portion that really speaks volumes: \"Some leaders and decision-makers who were already at the forefront of the fight against climate change may want to take advantage of the shock inflicted by the pandemic to implement long-lasting and wider environmental changes. They will, in effect, make \"good use\" of the pandemic by not letting the crisis go to waste.\" If that does not open your eyes to the agenda being pushed in this book, nothing will."

#> [25] "This is a great book to understand the mindset of the elite who rules the world and their vision for the future of humanity. Basically, Klaus Schwab claims that market economy and globalism failed (but forgets to mention the fact that he and his friends in Davos have been the ones who have been advocating those principles for the last 50 years and do not even attempt to apologize for their failure), therefore offers a planned economic model where governments and international organizations will be implementing policies in a top to bottom approach like in Soviet Union or Nazi Germany. He uses the success of lock down measures to justify his idea by claiming that without lock down measures there would be 3.1 million deaths in EU assuming a death rate between 0.4%-0.8%, which stands for 387.5 and 775 millions of infected people in EU where total population is only 450 millions. The book has many more similar claims based on assumptions that is not supported by data. I believe he tries to create fear among people to force a totalitarian feudal world which resembles George Orwell’s 1984, where a handful of elite will own everything and force their will through unelected bureaucrats. This is a very scary future we should avoid by any means and therefore I recommend everyone to read this book so that they prepare themselves for the coming totalitarian horror.

#> [26] "This book is an open conspiracy. Here it is before us, the plan to overwrite our society with the ideals of the rich and connected. I have to admire the audacity of these authors to reveal this plan so openly. How many more people will read this book than the relatively more obscure documentation on Agenda 21? The reviews tell me many us have the sense to see behind the flimsy veil that this book presents. But this is not a warning. This is mockery. Do you have the power to save your country? Do any of us? Even our cities or our communities? From history, we should have known that weakness was not a virtue, but a provocation for the strong to impose their will. So, Coyote has come to ask you what you're made of. If you don't say bones and grit and steely resolve, he's perfectly willing to keep you safe behind his rows of teeth.

#> [28] "This book’s arguments are in many cases poorly supported. He makes quotes and offers numbers without references. Many of the references he uses in other cases are op-Ed’s, books he or the other author have written, or from sources like Vox. There are huge leaps to conclusions which are sold with “the only clear conclusion” or some similar statement meant to sway the reader. Honestly, this would not pass muster as a grad school paper."

#> [30] "It's a very thought-provoking book that encouraged me to re-examine my life, my idea about capitalism and my connection to the larger community and my environment. It challenged me to think about what led to the current situation, encouraged me to be even more responsible about our collective future and be proactive about changing our world for the better. In the end, the book helped me to see the light in the darkness and to make use of the pandemic to explore and discover for myself a new future. "
